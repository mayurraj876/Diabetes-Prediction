<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the Project
    Objective of the project are :
        * To build an efficient model that can predict the probability of having Diabetes.
        * To visualize various independent variables like the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and dependent variable
        * To increase the model efficiency of the model with help of data processing and hyperparameter tuning.
        * To build a cloud-based user-friendly interface.
